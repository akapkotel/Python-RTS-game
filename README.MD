## Real Time Strategy- _a RTS game written in Python_

#### INTRODUCTION:

This is my ambitious struggle against Python inefficiencies. An RTS game
made with Python 3.6 and Arcade 2.26 Library is my attempt to make
something what should **NOT** be done with this language.

I've decided to use Arcade library because of it's useful _SpriteLists_
concept and efficient way of drawing Sprites. All advantages and
disadvantages of Arcade library are available here:

virtual environment, install requirements and run it by running
